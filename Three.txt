Here's a step-by-step guide to compile and run a simple "Hello, World!" program using GCC on WSL:

Create the Source File:
Open your favorite editor in WSL and create a file named hello.c with the following content:

c
Copy
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
Compile the Program:
In your WSL terminal, navigate to the directory where hello.c is located and run:

bash
Copy
gcc hello.c -o hello
This command tells GCC to compile hello.c and output an executable named hello.

Run the Executable:
Execute the program with:

bash
Copy
./hello
You should see the output:

Copy
Hello, World!
That's it! You've successfully compiled and run a "Hello, World!" program on WSL using GCC.

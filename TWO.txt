Below are two different approaches for adding Boost.Regex to your project.

a) Adding Boost.Regex “as part of the project”
This method assumes you’ve downloaded (or added via a submodule) the Boost libraries into your repository. For example, you might place the Boost source in a folder called third_party/boost.

Steps
Download Boost or Boost.Regex:
– Download the full Boost release (or just the Boost.Regex component) and extract it into a folder (for example, third_party/boost).

Update Your CMakeLists.txt:
Add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt to use your local copy of Boost. Adjust the paths as needed:

cmake
Copy
# Set the path to your local Boost installation
set(BOOST_ROOT "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/third_party/boost")
set(Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS ON)

# Find the Boost.Regex library. Adjust REQUIRED components as needed.
find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS regex)
if(Boost_FOUND)
    message(STATUS "Found Boost version ${Boost_VERSION}")
    include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
else()
    message(FATAL_ERROR "Boost not found!")
endif()

# Link your executable with Boost.Regex
target_link_libraries(calculatorv2 PRIVATE ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
# And for tests if needed:
target_link_libraries(calculatorv2_tests PRIVATE ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
This configuration tells CMake to look for Boost in your local third_party/boost directory rather than in system paths.

b) Adding Boost.Regex as an External Dependency from GitHub
You can use CMake’s FetchContent module to automatically download and build Boost.Regex from its GitHub repository. Note that Boost’s libraries have become more CMake‐friendly in recent releases.

Steps
Use FetchContent in Your CMakeLists.txt:
Add the following block before you define your targets (or in an appropriate section):

cmake
Copy
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    boost_regex
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/boostorg/regex.git
    GIT_TAG boost-1.80.0  # Use the appropriate tag for your version
)

# Download and configure Boost.Regex
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(boost_regex)
Link the Library to Your Targets:
Once Boost.Regex is available, link it to your executables. For example:

cmake
Copy
target_link_libraries(calculatorv2 PRIVATE boost_regex)
target_link_libraries(calculatorv2_tests PRIVATE boost_regex)
Depending on how Boost.Regex’s CMake files are set up in the repository, you might need to adjust the target name (for example, it might be called Boost::regex instead of boost_regex). Consult the repository documentation if needed.

Summary
Local Integration (a):
– Download and store Boost (or just the Regex component) in a local folder (e.g., third_party/boost), and point CMake to that location with BOOST_ROOT and find_package(Boost REQUIRED COMPONENTS regex).

External Dependency (b):
– Use CMake’s FetchContent module to download Boost.Regex directly from GitHub, then link the resulting target (e.g., boost_regex or Boost::regex) to your application.

Choose the approach that best fits your workflow. The first method makes your project self-contained, while the second keeps your repository lean by downloading the dependency on configuration time.

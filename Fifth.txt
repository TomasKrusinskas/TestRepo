Below is an explanation of how to generate linker map files for your project with both MSVC and GCC, along with a comparison of the differences between the generated map files.

Generating Linker Map Files
With MSVC
For Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVC), you can tell the linker to produce a map file by passing the /MAP flag. For example, if you’re using a Visual Studio project, you can add this flag in your project's linker settings. If you’re using CMake, you can add linker flags like so:

cmake
Copy
# For MSVC builds, add the /MAP flag to the linker
if(MSVC)
  target_link_options(calculatorv2 PRIVATE /MAP)
  target_link_options(calculatorv2_tests PRIVATE /MAP)
endif()
This instructs the MSVC linker to produce a file (usually named after your target, e.g., calculatorv2.map) containing information about symbol addresses, section layouts, and more.

With GCC
For GCC (or when using the GNU linker via Clang), you generate a linker map file by passing the flag -Wl,-Map,output.map to the linker. In CMake, you can do something similar:

cmake
Copy
# For GCC builds, add the -Wl,-Map flag to generate a map file
if(NOT MSVC)
  target_link_options(calculatorv2 PRIVATE -Wl,-Map,calculatorv2.map)
  target_link_options(calculatorv2_tests PRIVATE -Wl,-Map,calculatorv2_tests.map)
endif()
This tells GCC’s linker (ld) to output a map file with the given name (for example, calculatorv2.map) which will contain a textual map of symbol addresses and sections.

Comparing the Map Files: MSVC vs. GCC
Although both map files serve a similar purpose—to provide a detailed view of how the linker organized your binary—they differ in format and content details:

MSVC Map Files
Format:
MSVC-generated map files have a structured, multi-section format. They typically include:

A header with the timestamp, image base, and version.

A list of object files and libraries that contributed to the binary.

A sorted list of public symbols with their addresses.

A detailed layout of sections, segments, and memory ranges.

Usage:
They are useful for diagnosing issues like symbol conflicts, code size, and for understanding how the binary is organized in memory. The format is tailored to Windows executables and can be parsed with tools that understand MSVC’s format.

GCC (ld) Map Files
Format:
The GNU linker’s map files are typically simpler and more verbose. They include:

A summary of the memory regions used, including start addresses and sizes.

A detailed list of sections and segments, along with their addresses.

A list of symbols with addresses, often grouped by sections.

Usage:
These map files are useful for similar reasons: they help you analyze code size and layout. They are text-based and can be parsed or searched using standard text processing tools. They tend to be less formatted than MSVC’s, but provide all the necessary information.

Key Differences
Structure and Readability:

MSVC Map Files: Have a more segmented, column-based output that is integrated with the Windows binary model.

GCC Map Files: Are generally a large, continuous text file that details every section, making them potentially more verbose.

Content Details:

MSVC: Emphasizes public symbols, object file contributions, and a detailed breakdown by segment and section.

GCC: Provides a comprehensive dump of sections, memory regions, and symbol tables, often including additional details about the linker script usage.

Customization:
Both tools offer options to customize the map file output, but the options and granularity differ according to the linker’s documentation.

Summary
MSVC: Use the /MAP linker flag (or set it via CMake with target_link_options for MSVC) to generate a map file.

GCC: Use the flag -Wl,-Map,output.map (again, via target_link_options in CMake) to generate a GNU linker map file.

Comparison:
While both map files serve the same fundamental purpose, MSVC’s output is formatted specifically for Windows executables and tends to be more structured, whereas GCC’s output is a detailed textual dump of the binary layout. Both can be used for optimization, debugging, and understanding binary layout.

By adding the appropriate flags to your CMake build, you can generate these map files automatically as part of your build process and use them to diagnose and optimize your application.

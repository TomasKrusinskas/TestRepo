Below is an outline of how you can use Ghidra to decompile and compare binaries compiled with MSVC and GCC:

1. Prepare Your Binaries
MSVC Binary:
Compile your application with MSVC (using the /MAP option if desired to generate a map file). Ensure you have a release build (or comparable optimization level).

GCC Binary:
Compile your application with GCC (using -Wl,-Map,output.map if needed) with similar optimization settings (for example, -Os for size optimization).

Make sure both binaries are built from the same source to make the comparison meaningful.

2. Create a New Ghidra Project
Launch Ghidra:
Open Ghidra and create a new non-shared project.

Import Binaries:

Import the MSVC-compiled binary (e.g., calculatorv2.exe) into the project.

Then import the GCC-compiled binary (e.g., calculatorv2.exe built with GCC).

Run Analysis:
For each imported binary, allow Ghidra’s auto-analysis to complete. Accept default options or adjust them if you have specific requirements (e.g., for symbol recovery or data flow analysis).

3. Decompile and Inspect
Open the Decompiler Window:

For each binary, navigate to a function of interest (for instance, main or any other function).

Open the Decompiler window (Window > Decompiler) to view the pseudo-C code.

Examine the Decompiled Code:

Note differences in variable naming, control flow, and how compiler-specific constructs are handled.

MSVC decompilation might show different patterns in calling conventions or inline functions compared to GCC.

Take Notes:

For example, GCC might generate more inlined code, or have a different representation of loops and conditionals.

MSVC output may include additional runtime checks or different optimizations.

4. Compare the Output
Side-by-Side Comparison:
You can open two instances of Ghidra’s CodeBrowser (or use a split-screen arrangement) to compare the decompiled output of the same function from each binary.

Focus on Key Differences:

Control Flow: Check if loops, conditionals, and function calls are structured differently.

Variable Naming: While decompiled variable names are generated, differences in naming might indicate how each compiler handled symbols.

Optimizations: Look for differences in inlining, unrolling, and how dead code is removed.

Function Prologues/Epilogues: Compiler-specific conventions often lead to differences in the setup and teardown code.

Document Observations:
Write down the key differences, such as how MSVC and GCC each optimize or handle certain constructs.

5. Example Observations
MSVC Compiled Binary:

May show a more segmented structure reflecting Windows calling conventions.

Might use specific compiler intrinsics for certain operations.

The decompiled code could include additional annotations from the map file if symbols were preserved.

GCC Compiled Binary:

Often shows a flatter structure with more inlining of functions when using -Os.

Might display different optimizations in control flow and loop structures.

Variable names and intermediate computations can appear more streamlined or obfuscated, depending on optimization.

Summary
Using Ghidra, you can import and analyze both binaries. By decompiling functions and comparing the generated pseudo-C code, you’ll notice differences in how MSVC and GCC compile your source. These differences may include:

Variations in control flow representation and inlining decisions.

Differences in symbol and variable naming due to compiler-specific optimizations.

Different layouts of function prologues/epilogues reflecting platform calling conventions.

This process helps you understand how each compiler optimizes your code and can be useful for debugging, reverse engineering, or further optimization work.
